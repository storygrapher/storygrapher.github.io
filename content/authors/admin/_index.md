A talkative scientist with a ‘thing’ for multi variable problems- materials, fluid mechanics, humans and cultures. A history buff who loves reading as much as writing. Documents life, others’ and mine, in words and images.

*To observe is to seek the drama in the commonplace- in the laboratory, on the streets*
